The Never Ending Apartments
Climb. Fall. Repeat.
The Never Ending Apartments is an exhilarating third-person parkour challenge where every leap matters. Your goal is simple: scale an vast apartment complex, reach the rooftop platform, and claim your point. But be warned — one misstep sends you plummeting into the abyss, and you’ll lose what you’ve earned.

Features
Addictive Loop: Climb to the roof, score a point, and get teleported back down to start again.

Risk & Reward Gameplay: Every successful run brings triumph, but a single fall takes away your progress.

Vertical Parkour Action: Test your reflexes and precision with challenging jumps and tricky routes.

Minimalist Yet Intense Atmosphere: Focus on movement and mastery in an ever-rising struggle.
